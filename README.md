# Weather App
A simple weather app I built using *HTML* *CSS* and *JavaScript*

# Features
- A search bar to enter city name
- A button to get data info of entered city

# How It Works
- Default displayed city is Accra
- Enter city of choice in the search bar
- Click on _Get Weather_ button to fetch and display data
- City name and date is displayed
- Weather is displayed to match weather description
- Temperature is displayed in degrees celsius
- Humidity is displayed in percentage
- Windspeed is displayed in miles per hour

# What I Learned
- I learned about APIs and to fetch and display data using API keys
- I also learned about async/await in JavaScript
